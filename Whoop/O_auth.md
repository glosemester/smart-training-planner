OAuth 2.0
All endpoints for retrieving a WHOOP user's data require successful authorization via the OAuth 2.0 protocol. IETF RFC-6749 documents the full standard. While we will not explain OAuth 2.0 generally in this section, we will demonstrate how to use it to authorize an app's access to a WHOOP user's data after the user grants consent.

Any subsequent references to OAuth in this documentation will be referring to OAuth 2.0.

We recommend you use a library to manage the details of the OAuth flow. You can find recommended libraries in a variety of programming languages here.

Pre-requisite
Before starting, you must create an App in the WHOOP Developer Dashboard. You can follow the getting started to learn how if you have not already.

Required Information for OAuth
Client ID
The Client ID can be found after creating a client in the WHOOP Developer Dashboard.

Client Secret
You can find the Client Secret after creating a Client in the WHOOP Developer Dashboard.

Authorization URL
This WHOOP URL prompts a user to authorize your app to access the WHOOP user's data. After the user grants authorization, WHOOP will respond with an authorization code.

https://api.prod.whoop.com/oauth/oauth2/auth

Token URL
This WHOOP URL provides your app with the authorization code from the authorization URL after the WHOOP user authorizes your app to access their WHOOP data. This endpoint provides an access token in exchange for the authorization code.

https://api.prod.whoop.com/oauth/oauth2/token

Redirect URL
WHOOP will redirect the user to the Redirect URL after they authorize your App to access the request scopes. You must register the Redirect URL in the WHOOP Developer Dashboard.

A valid URL will take the form of https://whoop.com/example/redirect or whoop://example/redirect.

Note: Your OAuth library may reference Redirect URL as a Callback URL.

State
The state parameter is a security measure to prevent against CSRF attacks. It's a generated random string that you provide to WHOOP's server. Upon successful authorization by the user, WHOOP will respond with this same state value.

Your OAuth 2.0 library may handle this functionality for you; however, you may be responsible for explicitly using it by setting the option to true.

The state parameter must be eight characters long if you need to generate it yourself.

Scope
The scope parameter is how your application declares which data and what level of access is being requested.

When the OAuth flow prompts a WHOOP user to authorize access to your app, the user will see the list of scopes your app requested. The user must authorize access to them before WHOOP grants your app a token.

You can learn more about what scopes are available in the API Docs.

Request An Access Token
We highly recommend using a library to manage the flow. There are available libraries in many programming languages.

The steps that the library will follow are:

Your application will send a request to the Authorization URL for an authorization code.
WHOOP prompts the user to log in with their WHOOP credentials.
The user will confirm they authorize access to your app.
WHOOP will respond to the Redirect URL with an authorization code.
Your application will send a request to the Token URL, exchanging the authorization code for an access token (and optionally a refresh token if your app requested the offline scope).
Access Token Request Examples
Javascript and Passport
Using An Access Token
After receiving an access token, all requests must include the access token. Your app should pass the access token as a Bearer token in the Authorization header.

WHOOP will return the requested data if the access token is successfully verified. However, if the token is invalid, WHOOP returns a 401 - Unauthorized response.

Access Token Expiration
Access tokens are only valid for a short time. WHOOP provides the token expiry in the expires_in parameter (in seconds). After the token expires, your app must refresh the token.

Refreshing an Access Token
Access tokens are short-lived, depending on the expires_in value. WHOOP will respond with a (401 - Unauthorized) HTTP status code if your app sends a request with an expired access token.

When the access token is expired, you can no longer use it and must refresh the token. If you do not want to wait for the token to expire before refreshing, you can refresh the complete set of access tokens regularly. One strategy is to execute refreshing access tokens using a background cron job.

Existing access tokens are invalidated once your app uses the refresh token to generate a new access token. The access token from the refresh response is now the valid access token, and your app can use the new access token for future requests. Similarly, the refresh token from the refresh response is now the valid refresh token, and your app must use the new refresh token on the subsequent refresh request.

Another advantage to refreshing tokens in a recurring job is that it limits the likelihood of issues occurring with multiple concurrent requests attempting to refresh an expired token. When your app makes simultaneous refresh token requests, the first refresh request that reaches WHOOP will succeed. The second request would fail because the first request invalidates the refresh token.

Receiving a Refresh Token
WHOOP provides your app with a refresh token after completing the OAuth 2.0 flow if the offline scope is included in the authorization request. You must request the offline scope to receive a refresh token.

Required Information To Refresh
Refresh Token Endpoint
The WHOOP URL where your app sends a POST request including the refresh token in exchange for a new access token.

https://api.prod.whoop.com/oauth/oauth2/token

Refresh Token
If your app requests the offline scope during the OAuth authorization flow, WHOOP returns a refresh token that your app uses to refresh expired access tokens.

Client ID
The Client ID is a unique identifier for your Client app. Your app uses this ID to authenticate with WHOOP. You can create and manage this ID in the WHOOP Developer Dashboard.

Client Secret
The Client Secret is a secret value that accompanies a Client ID. You can view the Client Secret in the WHOOP Developer Dashboard.

Sample POST Request Payload
{
  "grant_type": "refresh_token",
  "refresh_token": "{{RefreshToken}}",
  "client_id": "{{ClientID}}",
  "client_secret": "{{ClientSecret}}",
  "scope": "offline"
}

The payload above uses Postman variables, rather than actual data. The variables represent:

RefreshToken - the value of the refresh token you receive along with an access token.
ClientID - the client identifier created in the WHOOP Developer Dashboard.
ClientSecret - the secret that accompanies the Client ID in the WHOOP Developer Dashboard.
Sample POST Response Payload
{
  "access_token": "the-value-of-the-new-access-token",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "refresh_token": "the-value-of-the-new-refresh-token",
  "scope": "offline other-scopes-requested",
  "token_type": "bearer"
}

Token Refresh Examples
Postman
Javascript
Revoking an Access Token
When a user disables your integration, you should revoke their access token from your application to respect their privacy. If you have adopted webhooks, revoking an access token will ensure that you no longer receive webhooks for this user.

To revoke an access token, you can use the revokeUserOauthAccess API endpoint.
