Webhooks
WHOOP webhooks allow you to get notified when an event takes place for users that have authenticated with your app. By subscribing to webhooks, you will be alerted when a user's data was updated rather than needing to constantly make API requests to check for updates.

Setting Up Webhooks
You will first need to create an HTTPS URL endpoint to receive webhooks. This endpoint should be capable of accepting POST requests with a body consisting of the webhook data format and be able to perform webhook signature validation.

note
If you are using multiple apps in the WHOOP dashboard, you will need a unique Webhook endpoint per app.

With your webhook endpoint set up, you can create or update an app to start accepting webhooks at that URL. Simply add your HTTPS URL to the Webhook URL section at the bottom of the page and save the app.

That's it! The next time a WHOOP user that has authenticated with your app triggers one of the supported webhook events, you will receive a webhook alerting you of the change.

Webhook Model Versions
WHOOP supports two webhook model versions that you can configure for each webhook URL:

v2 Webhooks (default)
v2 webhooks use UUID identifiers instead of integer IDs, providing better alignment with the v2 API endpoints. When you configure a webhook URL to use the v2 model version:

v1 Webhooks (legacy)
v1 webhooks used traditional integer IDs for identifying resources and maintain backward compatibility with existing integrations. v1 webhooks are no longer published.

Activity webhooks (workout and sleep events) will include UUID identifiers that correspond to the v2 API endpoints
Recovery webhooks will include the UUID identifier of the sleep that the recovery is associated with, rather than the cycle ID
Configuring Webhook Model Versions
In the WHOOP Developer Dashboard, you can configure the model version for each webhook URL individually:

Navigate to your app settings in the WHOOP Developer Dashboard
In the Webhooks section, you can add multiple webhook URLs
For each URL, select either v1 or v2 from the Model Version dropdown
Save your app configuration
This flexibility allows you to:

Migrate to v2 webhooks gradually by configuring different URLs for different versions
Test v2 webhook format on a separate endpoint before switching your production webhook
Support both v1 and v2 integrations simultaneously if needed
Migration Strategy
If you're migrating from v1 to v2 webhooks, consider setting up a separate webhook URL with v2 model version for testing before switching your production webhook configuration.

Webhook Specifications
Webhooks are sent over HTTPS as a POST request to your configured URL. The body of the webhook request includes the following fields:

user_id	
int64
The WHOOP User for the event

id	
int64 or string
Identifier of the object that triggered this webhook. For v1 webhooks: integer ID. For v2 webhooks: UUID. For recovery events in v2, this is the id (UUID) of the sleep that the recovery is associated with.

type	
string
Enum: "workout.updated" "workout.deleted" "sleep.updated" "sleep.deleted" "recovery.updated" "recovery.deleted"
The type of event that triggered this webhook

trace_id	
string
Trace ID for the event that triggered this webhook


Copy
{
"user_id": 10129,
"id": 10235,
"type": "workout.updated",
"trace_id": "d3709ee7-104e-4f70-a928-2932964b017b"
}
Webhook Event Types
There are several events that are published as webhooks:

Event Type	v1 ID Type (long)	v2 ID Type (UUID)	Explanation
recovery.updated	The id of the cycle for the recovery (long)	The id of the associated sleep (UUID)	Occurs when a recovery is created or updated. In v1, the ID refers to the cycle. In v2, the ID is the UUID of the sleep that the recovery is associated with.
recovery.deleted	The id of the cycle for the recovery (long)	The id of the associated sleep (UUID)	Occurs when a recovery is deleted. In v1, the ID refers to the cycle. In v2, the ID is the UUID of the sleep that the recovery is associated with. Note: a recovery is deleted when its associated sleep is deleted.
workout.updated	The id of the workout (long)	The id of the workout (UUID)	Occurs when a workout is created or updated.
workout.deleted	The id of the workout (long)	The id of the workout (UUID)	Occurs when a workout is deleted.
sleep.updated	The id of the sleep (long)	The id of the sleep (UUID)	Occurs when a sleep is created or updated.
sleep.deleted	The id of the sleep (long)	The id of the sleep (UUID)	Occurs when a sleep is deleted.
note
All webhook event types are sent to each configured webhook URL. If you don't need to process a specific event type, simply respond with a 2XX status code.

Webhooks Security
In order to validate that the webhooks you are receiving are originating from WHOOP, you will want to implement signature validation. This can be done by making use of two of the headers sent with each webhook request:

X-WHOOP-Signature - the actual signature
X-WHOOP-Signature-Timestamp - the milliseconds since epoch timestamp used to verify the signature
To verify the signature, first prepend the timestamp header value to the raw http request body. Then, generate a SHA256 HMAC signature of that string using the secret key for your app, which can be found in the WHOOP Developer Dashboard. Finally, base64 encode the result, and compare it to the signature header. If they do not match then the request is invalid and should be dropped.

See below for example signature validation pseudocode:

calculated_signature_string = base64Encode(HMACSHA256(timestamp_header + raw_http_request_body, client_secret))


Example Request Flow
To illustrate a webhook use case, check out the below example request flows that utilize webhooks.

v2 Webhook Example
WHOOP user 456 goes through the OAuth consent flow with your app, allowing you to read their sleep data.
WHOOP user 456 records a sleep. WHOOP assigns UUID 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000 to this sleep.
WHOOP makes a post request to your V2 webhook endpoint with the body of:
{
  "user_id": 456,
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "type": "sleep.updated",
  "trace_id": "e369c784-5100-49e8-8098-75d35c47b31b"
}

Based on seeing sleep.updated in the type field, your app makes a GET request to the v2/activity/sleep/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000 endpoint using the access token for WHOOP user 456 in order to retrieve the sleep data.
v1 Webhook Example
WHOOP user 456 goes through the OAuth consent flow with your app, allowing you to read their sleep data.
WHOOP user 456 records a sleep. WHOOP assigns id 1234 to this sleep.
WHOOP makes a post request to your v1 webhook endpoint with the body of:
{
  "user_id": 456,
  "id": 1234,
  "type": "sleep.updated",
  "trace_id": "e369c784-5100-49e8-8098-75d35c47b31b"
}

Based on seeing sleep.updated in the type field, your app makes a GET request to the v1/activity/sleep/1234 endpoint using the access token for WHOOP user 456 in order to retrieve the sleep data.
As you begin implementing webhooks, you should have logic for interpreting each of these webhook event types. The webhook model version you choose should align with the API version you're using to retrieve the data:

v2 webhooks → Use with v2 API endpoints (UUID IDs)
v1 webhooks → Use with v1 API endpoints (long IDs)
Webhooks Testing
To generate a webhook, first authenticate with your app to ensure your data is retrievable via the API. Then, open the WHOOP app and do one of the following:

Log an activity in the past (e.g. navigate to yesterday and create a 5 minute cycling activity) – once this activity is processed, your webhook endpoint will receive a workout.updated webhook.
Edit a previous sleep by changing the start or end time by 1 minute – once the sleep is processed, your webhook will receive both a sleep.updated webhook and a recovery.updated webhook.
You can then edit or delete the workout you created, and you can revert the sleep duration change. Each of these actions will also result in webhooks being sent – workout.updated, workout.deleted, and sleep.updated, respectively.

Delivery & Retries
WHOOP will retry webhook delivery for failed webhook requests five times over the course of about one hour. A webhook delivery is considered failed if it receives any response other than a successful 2XX, or if it receives no response before timing out.

In order to reduce the amount of delivery failures you encounter, you should consider processing the requests asynchronously after returning a successful response, e.g. with a queue worker.

Best Practices
While working with webhooks, it is important to follow these best practices in order to ensure that you can get the most out of the webhook system.

Respond quickly
As laid out in the Delivery & Retries section, WHOOP will not indefinitely retry if your webhook endpoint is determined to be unavailable. We recommend designing your webhook API to return a successful 2XX status code within a second and for high availability. If your webhook implementation has other dependencies or needs to do expensive work, one strategy is to have your API enqueue the event on a queue for asynchronous processing.

Validate signatures
Be sure to validate the message signature to ensure webhooks you receive were actually sent by WHOOP. Check out the Webhooks Security section to see more details on how to implement this.

Implement a reconciliation job
Since webhook delivery can fail webhooks should not be the sole source of truth for your application. Therefore, we recommend implementing a reconciliation job to occasionally fetch data from WHOOP.

Limitations
There are a few limitations to be aware of when implementing webhooks:

It is possible you will receive multiple webhook invocations for the same triggering event. You can make use of the trace_id field in the webhook to detect duplicate webhooks.
These are event based webhooks, meaning they are notifications of changes and not actually the changes themselves. You will need to call the API in order to retrieve the most up-to-date data around this event. There is an example of what this flow would look like in the Example Request Flow section.
It is possible that a webhook may be missed. You should implement a reconciliation job that can occasionally reach out to the WHOOP API for the data types you care about to fetch data that may have been missed.
Webhooks FAQs
Why are there only update and delete events? Do we get notified of create events?
Yes! When workouts, sleeps, or recoveries are created those events are published as an "update" event.

Are there webhooks for Day Strain, cycles, or body measurements?
Not at the moment; these data points should be retrieved by calling their respective APIs. All of the current webhook types are listed in the Event Types section.

How can I stop receiving webhooks for users who have disabled my integration?
It is best practice to revoke access tokens for users who have disabled your integration. Once you do revoke their access token, no webhooks will be sent for the user.
