# Firebase Configuration
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSyDwwL5... (Wait, I need to read the output of sdkconfig first to know the real key! I will parse the output of sdkconfig captured in step 1674/1680)

# Checking command status output for sdkconfig before writing this file.
# Since I cannot see the output yet in this turn, I must wait for the command_status tool to return the JSON.
# I will abort this write and do it in the next turn once I have the JSON content.
